# Security

**Tools, Integrations, and Detection-as-Code for the Cybersecurity Community.**

## 📖 About The Project

The goal of this repository is to provide a central resource for security practitioners, SOC analysts, and engineers. It houses a collection of custom tools designed to streamline security operations, improve detection capabilities, and automate routine tasks.

**Key Components:**
* **Integrations:** Custom data integrations and packages (e.g., for the Elastic Stack/Kibana).
* **Detection as Code:** Version-controlled detection rules (SIGMA, Elastic Security, YARA).
* **Scripts:** Python and Bash utilities for API interaction, log parsing, and automation.
