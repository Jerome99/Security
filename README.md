# Security

**Tools, Integrations, and Detection-as-Code for the Cybersecurity Community.**

## 📖 About The Project

The goal of this repository is to provide another resource for security practitioners, SOC analysts, and engineers. It houses a collection of custom tools designed to streamline security operations, improve detection capabilities, and automate routine tasks. It is still the early days and it is fairly empty, working on changing that but will always be a work in porogress. 

**Key Components:**
* **Integrations:** Custom data integrations and packages (e.g., for the Elastic Stack/Kibana).
* **Detection as Code:** Version-controlled detection rules (SIGMA, Elastic Security, YARA).
* **Scripts:** Python and Bash utilities for API interaction, log parsing, and automation.
